                        Happy 1.5
             The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell

This is the nth public release of our parser generator system for
Haskell, called Happy (a dyslexic acronym for 'A Yacc-like Haskell
Parser generator').  

What's new in Happy 1.5 (vs. Happy 0.9)

	* Monadic Lexical analysis
	* Simple Error recovery
	* so many bugfixes and small additions that I can't remember
	  them all.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 0.29 or 2.xx, and we also provide binaries for various
architectures.  All available from:

        ftp://ftp.dcs.gla.ac.uk/pub/haskell/happy

There is a Happy parser for Haskell currenly under construction - for
a snapshot of the code see
