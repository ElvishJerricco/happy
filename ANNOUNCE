                        Happy v0.9
             The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell

This is the third public release of our parser generator system for
Haskell, called Happy (a dyslexic acronym for 'A Yacc-like Haskell
Parser generator').  Happy is written in Haskell, uses a parser
generated by itself, and can be compiled using ghc, hbc or gofer.

The output parser can be compiled under *any* Haskell compiler,
as well as Mark Jones' Gofer interpreter.

Happy can be obtained by anonymous ftp from

      ftp://ftp.dcs.gla.ac.uk/pub/haskell/happy

Happy is covered by the GNU General Public License, see the
documentation for details.

To keep updated about the current status of Happy, you can read its
World Wide Web page:

Please send any bug reports and comments to simonm@dcs.gla.ac.uk.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from version 0.8 to 0.9:

* Happy should be much faster than before.

* Generated parsers will be about 5% smaller.

* Happy can now be compiled with ghc-0.26.

* Support for monadic parsers via %monad (see the documentation).

* New syntax: previously

	f :: { <type> }
	f : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  can now be written

	f :: { <type> }
	  : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  (i.e. omit the extra 'f'.  It was always ignored anyway :-)

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.
