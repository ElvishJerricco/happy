ANNOUNCING  Happy 1.15  - The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell

I'm pleased to announce version 1.15 of Happy, the parser generator
system for Haskell.

Changes from version 1.14 to 1.15

   * New %expect directive
   * the list of tokens passed to happyError now includes the current
     token (not %lexer).
   * added support for ambiguous grammars via Generalized LR parsing
   * added %partial to indicate a parser that can return a result
     before EOF is reached.

NOTE: Happy version 1.15 will be *required* for building newer
versions of GHC, due to use of %partial in GHC's parser.  If you build
GHC from source, get this release, or build it from CVS.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 5.04+, and we also provide binaries for some architectures.
