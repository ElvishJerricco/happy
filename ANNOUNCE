ANNOUNCING  Happy 1.13  - The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell
-----------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pleased to announce version 1.13 of Happy, the parser generator
system for Haskell.  Version 1.13 is released primarily to add support
for generating code that works with newer GHC versions (>= 5.03),
because some libraries have moved around as part of the move towards
hierarchical libraries.  Support for other Haskell 98 compilers
remains as before.

NOTE: Happy version 1.13 will be *required* for building newer
versions of GHC shortly.  If you build GHC from source, get this
release, or build it from CVS.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 4.xx or 5.xx (4.08+ recommended), and we also provide binaries
for some architectures.  The Happy homepage with links to the various
distributions lives at:
