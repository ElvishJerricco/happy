                            Happy 1.7
             The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell

This is the n+1th public release of our parser generator system for
Haskell, called Happy (a dyslexic acronym for 'A Yacc-like Haskell
Parser generator').  

What's new in Happy 1.7 (vs. Happy 1.6)

	* Several bugfixes
	* Array-based parsers work with GHC (i.e. -a and -g can be
          used together)

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 3.xx or 4.xx, and we also provide binaries for various
architectures.  The Happy homepage with links to the various
distributions lives at:
