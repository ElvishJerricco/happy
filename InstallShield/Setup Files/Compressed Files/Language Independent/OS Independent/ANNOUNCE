ANNOUNCING  Happy 1.8  - The LALR(1) Parser Generator for Haskell
--------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm pleased to announce version 1.8 of Happy, the parser generator
system for Haskell.  Changes in this version, relative to version 1.6
(the previous full release):

	* Parser table compression, and more efficient
	  table encoding when used with GHC.  Large grammars
	  can now be compiled in much less time/space than
	  before using GHC.

	* Yacc-style operator precedence, thanks to patches
	  from Hermann Oliveira Rodrigues <hermann@dcc.ufmg.br>
	  and Josef Svenningsson <josefs@cs.chalmers.se>.

	* A debug option which causes the generated parser to
	  print tracing information at each step during parsing.

Happy is available in source form, which can be compiled with GHC
version 4.xx (4.08 recommended), and we also provide binaries for
various architectures.  The Happy homepage with links to the various
distributions lives at:
