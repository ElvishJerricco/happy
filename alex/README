		       Alex: A Lexical Analyser Generator

			       Version 1.2

			   20th November, 2002

Alex is a Lex-like package for generating Haskell scanners.  For
complete documentation, see the doc directory.

This version is the first phase of integration with Happy, the Haskell
parser generator.  There is no difference in the code base, but the
Makefiles try to bring it in line with fptools.  If you have any
questions or comments about the new build system, email:

Isaac Jones,
ijones@syntaxpolice.org

Alex is now covered by a BSD-Style licence; see the licence file in the `doc'
directory for details.

Version 1.1 in April 2000 made some minor changes to bring it into
line with Haskell 98.

The sources are in the the `src' directory and the documentation in the `doc'
directory; the examples given in the documentation have been placed in the
`examples'.

The source code in the `src' and `examples' directories is intended for
a Haskell 98 compiler: it has been tested with Hugs 98 (February 2000) and
GHC 4.06.

Please report any bugs or comments to the email addresses given below.

Share and enjoy,
