-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from version 0.9a to version 1.2

* Supports Haskell 1.4

* Lots of bugs fixed

* Performance: the parser generator is at least 20% faster, and
  generated parsers should be faster due to the replacement of a
  data type with a newtype.

* Simple error recovery: designed to be enough to implement the
  Haskell layout rule.

* Revamped monad support: the monad can now be threaded through
  the lexer, enabling passing of state between the parser and the
  lexer (handy for the Haskell layout rule), and consistent error
  handling.

* The %newline feature is removed, the same effect can be achieved
  using the new monad support.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes from version 0.8 to 0.9:

* Happy should be much faster than before.

* Generated parsers will be 5-10% smaller.

* Happy now compiles with ghc-0.26.

* Support for monadic parsers via %monad (see the documentation).

* New syntax: previously

	f :: { <type> }
	f : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  can now be written

	f :: { <type> }
	  : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  (i.e. omit the extra 'f'.  It was always ignored anyway :-)

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.
