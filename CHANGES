Changes from version 0.8 to 0.9:

* Happy should be much faster than before.

* Generated parsers will be 5-10% smaller.

* Happy now compiles with ghc-0.26.

* Support for monadic parsers via %monad (see the documentation).

* New syntax: previously

	f :: { <type> }
	f : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  can now be written

	f :: { <type> }
	  : ...
	  | ...
	  etc.

  (i.e. omit the extra 'f'.  It was always ignored anyway :-)

* Miscellaneous bug fixes.
